Welcome to the Unreal Tournament source code!
===============================

This is the source code page for **Unreal Tournament on GitHub**.  Unreal Tournament is being created in close collaboration between Epic and the Unreal Engine 4 developer community.  You’ll be able to see live commits from Epic developers along with integrated code submissions from the community!  You can also use this code as a starting point for experimentation and Unreal Tournament mod creation.

As described in the [License Agreement](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealTournament/blob/master/LICENSE.pdf), assets residing in **UnrealTournament/Content/RestrictedAssets** may only be used for Unreal Tournament submissions.

We’re working hard to get a basic version of Unreal Tournament deathmatch up and running to provide a basis for design iteration and further development. You can follow our progress on this fork, and start extending or modding the code as it becomes functional. If you want to get involved, join us on our [design forums](https://forums.unrealengine.com/) to participate in design discussions, and go to the [development forums](https://forums.unrealengine.com/) to find projects that need help and discover other opportunities to contribute.

Check out the [Unreal Tournament wiki](https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Unreal_Tournament_Development) for documentation on the design and development process of the game.
